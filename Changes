    - Added =encoding to pod, since I have UTF-8 in the pod
    - Correction in the doc for has_cpandir following a chat with ANDK.

0.02 2013-11-19

    - has_cpandir now defaults to 0, as the <has_cpandir> element
      is only present if it's set to 1.
    - Now we skip entries with type=list, as they're not users they're
      mailing lists. Dropped the 'type' field from PAUSE::Users::User,
      since we're only dealing with one type.
    - Added a bunch more documentation.
    - Added Changes file

0.01 2013-11-17
