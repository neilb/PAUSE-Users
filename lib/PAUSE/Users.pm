=head1 NAME

PAUSE::Users - interface to PAUSE's users file (00whois.xml)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PAUSE::Users;

 my $users    = PAUSE::Users->new();
 my $iterator = $users->user_iterator();

 while (defined($user = $iterator->next_user)) {
   print "PAUSE id = ", $user->id, "\n";
   print "Name     = ", $user->fullname, "\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE>: this is very much an alpha release. Any and all feedback appreciated.

PAUSE::Users provides an interface to the C<00whois.xml>
file produced by the Perl Authors Upload Server (PAUSE).
This file contains a list of all PAUSE users, with some basic information
about each user.

At the moment this module supports a single iterator interface.
The C<next_user()> method returns an instance of L<PAUSE::Users::User>
(I know, bit of an odd name).

Here's the simple skeleton for iterating over all PAUSE users:

 my $iterator = PAUSE::Users->new()->user_iterator();

 while (my $user = $iterator->next_user) {
    # doing something with $user
 }

The user object supports the following methods:

=over 4

=item id

The user's PAUSE id. For example my PAUSE id is NEILB.

=item fullname

The full name of the user, as they would write it.
So expect to see Kanji and plenty of other non-ASCII characters here.
You are UTF-8 clean, right?

=item asciiname

An ASCII version of the user's name. This might be the romaji version
of a Japanese name, or the fullname without any accents.
For example, author NANIS has fullname A. Sinan Ünür,
and asciiname A. Sinan Unur.

=item email

The contact email address for the author, or C<CENSORED> if the
author specified that their email address should not be shared.

=item has_cpandir

Set to C<1> if the author has a directory on CPAN, and 0 if not.
This is only true (1) if the author I<currently> has something on CPAN.
If you upload a dist then delete it, the dist will be on BackPAN but
not on CPAN, and C<has_cpandir> will return 0.

=item homepage

The author's homepage, if they've specified one.
This might be their blog, their employer's home page,
or any other URL they've chosen to associate with their account.

=item introduced

When the author's PAUSE account was created, specified as
seconds since the epoch. This may change to being an instance
of L<DateTime>.

=head1 00whois.xml file format

The meat of the file is a list of C<E<lt>cpanidE<gt>> elements,
each of which contains details of one PAUSE user:

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <cpan-whois xmlns='http://www.cpan.org/xmlns/whois'
            last-generated='Sat Nov 16 18:19:01 2013 UTC'
            generated-by='/home/puppet/pause/cron/cron-daily.pl'>
  
  ...
  
  <cpanid>
   <id>NEILB</id>
   <type>author</type>
   <fullname>Neil Bowers</fullname>
   <email>neil@bowers.com</email>
   <has_cpandir>1</has_cpandir>
  </cpanid>
  
  ...
  
 </cpan-whois>

In addition to all PAUSE users, the underlying file (00whois.xml)
also contains details of perl.org mailing lists.
For example, here's the entry for Perl5-Porters:

 <cpanid>
  <id>P5P</id>
  <type>list</type>
  <asciiname>The Perl5 Porters Mailing List</asciiname>
  <email>perl5-porters@perl.org</email>
  <info>Mail perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org</info>
  <has_cpandir>0</has_cpandir>
 </cpanid>

All B<list> type entries are ignored by C<PAUSE::Users>.

=head1 NOTES

I started off trying a couple of XML modules, but I was surprised at
how slow they were, and not really iterator-friendly.
So the current version of the iterator does line-based parsing using
regexps. You really shouldn't do that, but 00whois.xml is automatically
generated, follows a well-defined format, which very rarely changes.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Parse::CPAN::Whois> is another module that parses 00whois.xml,
but you have to download it yourself first.

L<Parse::CPAN::Authors> is another module for getting information about
PAUSE users, but based on C<01.mailrc.txt.gz>.

L<CPAN::Index::API::File::Whois> provides a similar interface to 00whois.xml.

L<CPAN::Search::Author> does a real-time search for CPAN authors
using L<search.cpan.org|http://search.cpan.org>.

L<CPAN::Source> fetches 4 of the PAUSE indices and lets you query an aggregation
of the data they contain.

L<PAUSE::Permissions>, L<PAUSE::Packages>.
